Total: 83.0 / 85.0 (97.65%)

Code:
(CO: won’t compile, CR: crashes, FR: UI freezes/unresponsive, NS: not submitted)


Notes:  When a shape is selected, a user can change its characteristics (color, line thickness). I think the assignment asked for the shape color and line thickness to be highlighted. 


## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (60)

1. [5/5] Saving data. File-Save can be used to save the model (the user should be promoted for a file-save location using a JDialog)

-5 Save feature not implemented
-2 The app doesn't prompt the user for a file name
-3 The file is not saved

2. [5/5] Loading data. File-Load can be used to load and restore the shapes that were saved using a JDialog. The view (e.g. window size, view-option) does not need to be restored, but all shapes should be saved and restored to the canvas, with the appropriate color, line thickness and so on.

7. [4/4] Rectangle drawing tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then draw rectangles in the canvas by holding and dragging the mouse, using the selected colour and line thickness.

-4 Rectangle drawing tool not implemented or doesn't work

-2 A preview of the rectangle does not appear while the mouse button is being dragged

8. [4/4] Circle drawing tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then draw circles or ellipses in the canvas by holding and dragging the mouse, using the selected colour and line thickness.

-4 Circle drawing tool not implemented or doesn't work
-2 Circle drawing doesn't work as expected (the first corner [or centre] of the circle/ellipse should correspond to the position of mouse press, and the second corner [or radius] should correspond to the position of the mouse release)
-2 A preview of the circle/ellipse does not appear while the mouse button is being dragged

9. [3/3] Fill tool: The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then click on a shape (rectangle or circle/ellipse) to fill it with the current colour.

-3 Fill tool not implemented or doesn't work
-2 Fill tool doesn't use the currently selected colour

-2 Colour picker not implemented or doesn't work
-1 There is no visual indication of the selected colour

12. [5/5] Line thickness palette. Displays at least 3 line widths, graphically, and allows the user to select line width for new shapes. [6 marks for supporting at least 3 lines; 4 marks for showing them graphically].

-5 Line thickness palette not implemented or doesn't work
-2 Line thickness palette has less than 3 thickness options
-3 Options are not displayed graphically

-1 The line thickness palette is not updated to relect the selected shape

14. [10/10] Moving shapes. Users can move shapes around the screen by selecting, then dragging them. There should be an indication which shape is selected. [5 marks for moving, 5 marks for selection indicator]

15. [2/2] The interface should clearly indicate which tool, color and line thickness are selected at any time.

-2 The interface does not indicate which tool is selected at least in one situation

16. [2/2] The interface should enable/disable controls if appropriate.

-2 There was at least one situation when a control could not be used, but it was not disabled


## LAYOUT (10)

-4 Innapropriate widgets were used to implement the window layout
-4 Implementation did not use only Swing widgets

-1 This application is missing a tool palette

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND MVC (5)

1. [5/5] Gradle.build exists, `gradle build` and `gradle run` works successfully.

-5 There is no build config file; or it didn't work
-4 There was a problem in the gradle.build, which the TA had to fix to run the program; details:
-3 The makefile works to compile the program, but not to run it

2. [0/0] If third-party graphics/images are used in the user interface, their origin and licence are included in the README file (this item can be negative).

-2 Third-party graphics/images were used, but there is no information about them in the README


## ADDITIONAL/BONUS FEATURES (max of 10 optional bonus)

1. [10/10] Application incorporates one or more enhancements totalling 10%, as described in the requirements.

+5 Scale shapes: the ability to change the scale/size of any shape by selecting it, then grabbing a corner of the shape, and dragging to increase/decrease its size.
+5 Group shapes: select multiple shapes, then group them together so that they can be dragged/resized as a single entity.
+5 Customizable color palette: you can wholly or partially customize color buttons in the palette (e.g. right-click a button and choose a new color for that button from a color-chooser dialog).
+10 Dynamic use of widgets: if display is resized too small, replace a set of widgets with a space-optimized widget (e.g. replace stroke width with combo box, color palette with subset of buttons and so on). This should be a dynamic manipulation of at least 2 sets of widgets.
+10 System-level copy/paste: support pasting an image (any supported format) to an outside program (e.g. MS Paint, Photoshop, Pixelmator).
